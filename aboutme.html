        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <h2>Emily</h2>
        <p>Hi everyone! My name is Emily. I am pursuing a degree in Professional Studies with certificates in Social Media Marketing, Graphic Design, and Web Development. I am hoping to use this degree to help brand businesses online.</p>
        <p>I am from Missouri. I am married and have a 19 month old daughter. I am also expecting a son in May. Yay! I love spending time with my family. I love doing home renovation projects with my family. </p>
        <p>I love BYU-I Online because it allows me to still spend plenty of time at home with my daughter. In my spare time I have a personal blog website that I run. Learning web design would definietly make me more self sufficient in that. I can't wait to learn with you all this semester.</p>
